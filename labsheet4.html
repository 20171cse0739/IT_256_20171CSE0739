  <h1>VALENTINO ROSSI</h1><br />
  <a href="#Table">Down</a><br />
  <p id="firstpara"style="color:blue;">Valentino Rossi (/ˈrɒsi/; Italian: [valenˈtiːno ˈrossi]; born 16 February 1979) is an Italian professional motorcycle road racer and multiple MotoGP World Champion.</p>

<p id="secondpara" style="color:red;">Rossi is widely considered one of the most successful motorcycle racers of all time, with nine Grand Prix World Championships to his name – seven of which are in the premier class. Rossi is also the only road racer to have competed in 400 or more Grands Prix.[1] He has ridden with number 46 his entire career, also when being the title defender.</p>

<p id="thirdpara" style="color:purple;">After graduating to the premier class in 2000, Rossi won the 500cc World Championship and 8 Hours of Suzuka with Honda in 2001, the MotoGP World Championships (also with Honda) in 2002 and 2003 and continued his streak of back-to-back championships by winning the 2004 and 2005 titles after leaving Honda to join Yamaha. All of those titles were won in a dominant manner, being decided before the final round on all occasions. He lost the 2006 title with a crash in the final round at Valencia, ceding the title to his former Honda teammate Nicky Hayden. In 2007 Rossi and Yamaha were of no match to a dominant Casey Stoner on a Ducati, and Rossi ultimately finished a then career-low third overall. </p>

<p id="fourthpara">Rossi regained the title in 2008 following several tight duels with title defendant Stoner and retained it in 2009.[2] After a 2010 marred by a broken leg and no title challenge, Rossi left Yamaha to join Ducati for the 2011 season.[3][4] Rossi replaced Stoner at Ducati, who went on to win the 2011 title with Honda instead while Rossi endured a difficult spell with his compatriot marque. It was confirmed in 2012 that he would rejoin Yamaha for the 2013 and 2014 seasons[5] after Rossi suffered two winless seasons while at Ducati</p>


<p id="fifthpara" style="color:green ;">Following his return to Yamaha he has finished second overall in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Rossi led the championship for the vast majority of the 2015 season before being surpassed by team colleague Jorge Lorenzo in the final round at Valencia, with Rossi losing out as a result of a grid penalty sustained for a controversial clash with Honda rider Marc Márquez in the previous Malaysian round. During Rossi's second stint at Yamaha, Márquez won multiple titles in succession with Rossi often having to settle for podium finishes and only occasional wins. After Rossi won the 2017 Dutch TT, a winless streak of multiple years followed, although he managed to finish third in the 2018 championship even during this period. </p>


<p id="sixthpara" style="color:yellow;">Rossi is currently contracted to race until the end of the 2020 season, when he will be 41 years old.[6] He is also a team owner of junior class team Sky Racing Team by VR46 that competes in Moto2 and Moto3.</p>

<p id="seventhpara"style="color:orange;">The 1996 championship season marks the debut of Valentino Rossi. He had some success in his first year, scoring consistent points and sometimes finishing just off the podium from his very first race at Malaysia to Italy, but retired in both the French and Dutch rounds. He scored more points by finishing fifth at the German but once again retired at the British round.
At the 1996 Austrian Grand Prix, Valentino would score his first ever podium in the form of a third place after battling with Jorge Martínez.[13][14] At the next race, which was the 1996 Czech Republic Grand Prix, he scored his first ever pole position on Saturday and his first ever race victory in the 125cc class on an AGV Aprilia RS125R on Sunday, after fighting with Jorge Martínez.[15]
After his victory, Rossi would continue to score points in Imola, retire twice at the Catalan and Rio rounds, and score even more points at the last round in Australia. He would finish his first season in ninth place with 111 points.</p>

<p id="eightthpara" style="color:pink;">After winning the title in 1997, Rossi moved up to the 250cc class the following year. In 1998, the Aprilia RS250 was reaching its pinnacle and had a team of riders in Valentino Rossi, Loris Capirossi and Tetsuya Harada. Rossi's year started off poor, retiring in the first two rounds: Japan and Malaysia. He would bounce back by scoring three consecutive second places in Spain, Italy and France, but would once again retire at the Madrid round.

He scored his first victory at the 1998 Dutch TT, winning with more than 19 seconds from second place Jürgen Fuchs.[18] He would retire once again at the British round, but bounced back by scoring a podium place in Germany, finishing third.

He would once more retire in the Czech Republic, crashing out of the race, but a flurry of victories from Imola to Argentina saw him end in second place in his rookie year in the class with 201 points, just 23 points clear of 1998 250cc champion Loris Capirossi.
